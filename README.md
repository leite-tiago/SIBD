# 🗄️ SIBD – Information Systems and Databases

This repository contains my work for the course **Information Systems and Databases (SIBD)**, part of the Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering. It includes exercises, exams, and a full project developed in four stages. The course covered relational database concepts, SQL, data modeling, normalization, and information systems fundamentals.
